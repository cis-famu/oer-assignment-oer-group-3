## Introduction 
Chapter 3 introduces control structures in C++ which are essential elements that determine the flow of execution in a program. They allow programmers to manage the order and repetition of statements based on specified conditions, enabling the creation of dynamic and responsive applications. There are three primary types of control structures in C++: sequence, selection, and iteration.

Understanding and effectively using control structures are crucial for creating structured and readable code. They provide the flexibility needed to handle different scenarios and make C++ programs dynamic and responsive to various conditions.

## Control Structures 
A computer can execute a program in various ways, each serving a specific purpose. It can follow a linear progression, processing instructions one after another, known as sequential execution. Alternatively, it can make decisions based on conditions, taking different paths through the program, referred to as branching or selective execution. Repetitive execution, facilitated by loop structures, allows the computer to perform a statement or group of statements iteratively. Lastly, programs can be organized by dividing tasks into modular units, or functions, which can be called upon when needed, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

### SELECTION: if AND if . . . else
Before delving into selection or repetition statements, it's crucial to grasp the concept of logical expressions and their evaluation. The execution of these statements hinges on logical expressions, which involve assessing the truth or falsehood of a condition. Thus, a fundamental step in programming is gaining an understanding of logical expressions and acquiring the skills to evaluate them effectively. This knowledge lays the groundwork for making decisions and controlling the flow of a program through conditions and loops. 

**Logical expression:** An expression that evaluates to true or false is called a logical expression. 

In C++, the double equal sign (==) is referred to as the equality operator. It serves the purpose of comparing two expressions to ascertain if they are equal. On the other hand, the single equal sign (=) is known as the assignment operator. Unlike the equality operator, the assignment operator is used to assign the value of an expression to a variable. It is essential to distinguish between the two, as the equality operator checks for equality, while the assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.

The relational operators in programming are binary operators, necessitating two operands for their operation. These operators facilitate comparisons between values, and the outcome of such comparisons is a boolean result - either true or false. Consequently, expressions utilizing these relational operators consistently yield a boolean outcome, encapsulating the logic of whether the relationship between the two operands holds true or false.

For Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    
    bool isGreaterThan = (8 > 3);

    cout << "Is 8 greater than 3? " << isGreaterThan << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Review Questions 
1. Question: What is the greater than or equal to operator?
2. Question: What is the equality operator
3. True/False: Each of the relational operators is a binary operator; that is, it requires two operands. 

*Answers: 1. **<=** 2. **==** 3. **True***

### Relational Operators and Simple Data Types
Relational operators can be applied to all three fundamental data typesâ€”integers, real numbers (float or double), and characters. In the given example, expressions leverage both integers and real numbers to demonstrate the versatility of relational operators across these diverse data types.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << setw(10) << "Expression" << setw(30) << "Meaning" << setw(10) << "Value" << endl;

    bool result1 = (8 < 15);
    cout << setw(10) << "8 < 15" << setw(30) << "8 is less than 15" << setw(10) << result1 << endl;

    bool result2 = (6 != 6);
    cout << setw(10) << "6 != 6" << setw(30) << "6 is not equal to 6" << setw(10) << result2 << endl;

    bool result3 = (2.5 > 5.8);
    cout << setw(10) << "2.5 > 5.8" << setw(30) << "2.5 is greater than 5.8" << setw(10) << result3 << endl;

    bool result4 = (5.9 <= 7.5);
    cout << setw(10) << "5.9 <= 7.5" << setw(30) << "5.9 is less than or equal to 7.5" << setw(10) << result4 << endl;

    bool result5 = (7 <= 10.4);
    cout << setw(10) << "7 <= 10.4" << setw(30) << "7 is less than or equal to 10.4" << setw(10) << result5 << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Review Questions
1. True/False: 8 < 15 means 8 is less than 15
2. True/False: 6 != 6 means	6 is not equal to 6
3. True/False: 5.9 <= 7.5 means	5.9 is less than or equal to 7.5

*Answers: 1. **True** 2. **False** 3. **True***

### Comparing Characters 
In the context of char values, the truth or falsehood of an expression involving relational operators is contingent upon the machine's collating sequence. The collating sequence establishes the order in which characters are arranged, influencing the outcome of comparisons. Notably, the relational operators for char values compare the ASCII or Unicode values assigned to the characters based on the collating sequence. Therefore, the result of such expressions varies depending on the specific character set and encoding used by the machine.

For example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    char char1 = 'A';
    char char2 = 'B';

    bool isCharLess = (char1 < char2);
    cout << "Is char1 less than char2? " << isCharLess << endl;

    bool isCharEqual = (char1 == char2);
    cout << "Is char1 equal to char2? " << isCharEqual << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Review Questions
1. True/False: The data type bool has two values
2. True/False: In C++, there are two selections, or branch control structures
3. True/False: The value for the char "/" equals 47

*Answers: 1. **True** 2. **True** 3. **True***

### One-Way Selection
One-way selection in C++ programming refers to the use of the if statement to conditionally execute a block of code based on a specified condition. It allows the program to make a decision: if the condition is true, the code inside the if block is executed; otherwise, it is skipped.

For example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num = 10;

    if (num > 5) 
        cout << "The number is greater than 5." << endl;
    

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the if statement checks if the variable num is greater than 5. If the condition is true, it prints a message to the console. If the condition is false, the code inside the if block is not executed.

### Review Questions
1. True/False: The condition in the else statement is a boolean expression that determines whether the block of code inside the else statement should be executed.
2. True/False: One-way selection is typically implemented using the if statement.
3. True/False: One-way selection in C++ refers to a control flow structure where a program makes a decision based on a condition.

*Answers: 1. **False** 2. **True** 3. **True***

### Two-Way Selection
C++ offers the if...else statement to facilitate two-way selections in programming scenarios. In situations where a decision must be made between two alternatives, such as calculating a part-time employee's paycheck using an overtime payment formula if they worked extra hours, and using the regular formula otherwise, the if...else statement allows for the implementation of such choices in the code logic.

Consider a scenario where you are writing a program to determine whether a given number is even or odd. In this case, the program needs to make a decision and choose between two alternatives based on the nature of the number. C++ provides the if...else statement for such two-way selections:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int number;

    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> number;

    if (number % 2 == 0) 
        cout << number << " is an even number." << endl;
     else 
        cout << number << " is an odd number." << endl;
    

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the program checks if the entered number is even or odd using the modulo operator (%). If the remainder after dividing by 2 is zero, the program executes the code inside the if block, indicating that the number is even. Otherwise, it executes the code inside the else block, indicating that the number is odd. The if...else statement helps in making decisions and executing the appropriate code based on the condition evaluated.

### Review Questions 
1. True/False: Two-way selection in C++ refers to a control flow structure where a program makes a decision between two alternatives based on a condition.
2. True/False: The else statement in a two-way selection structure provides an alternative block of code to be executed when the condition specified in the if statement is false.
3. True/False: : In a two-way selection structure, the condition specified in the if statement is evaluated. If the condition is true, the code inside the if block is executed, and the code inside the else block is skipped. If the condition is false, the code inside the if block is skipped, and the code inside the else block is executed.

*Answers: 1. **True** 2. **True** 3. **True***

### int Data Type and Logical (Boolean) Expressions
In earlier versions of C++, there were no dedicated built-in data types specifically designed for logical or Boolean values with "true" and "false." Instead, logical expressions were often represented using the int data type. In this context, logical expressions evaluated to either 1 (representing true) or 0 (representing false), and these values were stored in variables of type int. Therefore, developers utilized the int data type to handle and manipulate logical expressions.

It's important to note that in this convention, any nonzero value was considered as representing true. This means that when evaluating logical conditions, a result of 1 indicated true, while a result of 0 indicated false. This approach allowed for the use of integer variables to convey and work with Boolean logic in the absence of dedicated Boolean data types.

For Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int number;

    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> number;

    int isGreaterThan10 = (number > 10);

    if (isGreaterThan10) 
        cout << number << " is greater than 10." << endl;
     else 
        cout << number << " is not greater than 10." << endl;
    

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the expression (number > 10) evaluates to either 1 (true) or 0 (false) depending on whether number is greater than 10 or not. This result is stored in the int variable isGreaterThan10.

When we evaluate isGreaterThan10 in the if statement, any nonzero value (in this case, 1) is treated as true, and the corresponding message is printed accordingly.

### Review Questions
1. Question: If a logical expression evaluates to true, what integer value is typically assigned when using the int data type?
2. Question: In modern C++, what dedicated data type is used for Boolean values?
3. True/False: Using bool is more expressive and provides clearer code. It explicitly represents true and false values without relying on non-zero and zero integers.

*Answers: 1. **1** 2. **bool** 3. **True***

### bool Data Type and Logical (Boolean) Expressions
In contemporary versions of C++, a dedicated data type, bool, is available to handle logical (Boolean) values, introducing clarity and specificity to Boolean expressions. This data type consists of the reserved words bool, true, and false. In this context, true is assigned the value 1, while false is assigned the value 0, providing a standardized and explicit representation for true and false within the language.

For Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {

    bool isEven = false;

    int number;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> number;

    isEven = (number % 2 == 0);

    if (isEven) 
        cout << number << " is an even number." << endl;
     else 
        cout << number << " is an odd number." << endl;
    

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the program checks if the entered number is even using the modulo operator (%). The result of the expression (number % 2 == 0) is assigned to the bool variable isEven. The if statement then evaluates the bool variable and executes the appropriate block of code based on whether the expression is true or false. The use of bool and the reserved words true and false enhances code readability and expressiveness.

### Review Questions
1. True/False:  The reserved words associated with the bool data type are bool, true, and false.
2. In older versions of C++, how were logical (Boolean) expressions typically represented without the bool data type?
3. What value does the identifier false represent in C++?

*Answers: 1. **True** 2. **int** 3. **0***

### Logical (Boolean) Operators and Logical Expressions
Logical operators are special symbols used to perform logical operations on Boolean values (true or false). In C++, the main logical operators are:

1. Logical AND (&&):
   * Returns true if both operands are true; otherwise, it returns false.

2. Logical OR (||):
   * Returns true if at least one of the operands is true; it returns false if both are false.

3. Logical NOT (!):
   * Returns true if the operand is false and vice versa. It negates the value of the operand.

Logical expressions are combinations of relational expressions and logical operators that evaluate to a Boolean value (true or false). They are used to express conditions or criteria that control the flow of a program.

For Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x = 5, y = 10;

    bool resultAnd = (x > 0 && y > 0);
    bool resultOr = (x > 0 || y > 0);
    bool resultNot = !(x > y);

    cout << "Logical AND: " << resultAnd << endl;
    cout << "Logical OR: " << resultOr << endl;
    cout << "Logical NOT: " << resultNot << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, logical expressions are created using the logical AND (&&), logical OR (||), and logical NOT (!) operators. These expressions evaluate conditions based on the values of x and y and produce Boolean results.

Logical operators and expressions are crucial for controlling the flow of a program, making decisions, and implementing conditional statements like if, while, and for loops. They provide the foundation for creating dynamic and responsive code based on various conditions within a program.

### Review Questions
1. True/False: The three main logical operators in C++ are AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!).
2. True/False: A logical expression is a combination of relational expressions and logical operators that evaluates to a Boolean value (true or false).
3. Question: How is the result of a logical expression represented in C++ (data type)?

*Answers: 1. **True** 2. **True** 3. **bool***

### Order of Precedence
In C++, the order of precedence determines the sequence in which operators are evaluated within an expression. When an expression contains multiple operators, the order of precedence dictates the grouping and evaluation hierarchy. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before operators with lower precedence.

Operators at a higher precedence level are evaluated before operators at a lower precedence level. Parentheses () can be used to override the default precedence and explicitly specify the order of evaluation within an expression.

Understanding the order of precedence is crucial for writing correct and predictable expressions in C++, as it influences how expressions are parsed and executed by the compiler.

For Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 5, b = 3, c = 2;
    bool condition = true;

    int result = a + b * c - (a % c);
    cout << "Result: " << result << endl;

    bool isTrue = (a > b) && condition || (c != 0);
    cout << "Is True: " << boolalpha << isTrue << endl;

    int maxNumber = (a > b) ? a : b;
    cout << "Max Number: " << maxNumber << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
In this example:

The expression a + b * c - (a % c) involves addition, multiplication, and modulo operators. The order of precedence ensures that multiplication is performed before addition, and the modulo operation is given higher precedence than addition and subtraction.

The expression (a > b) && condition || (c != 0) includes logical AND (&&), logical OR (||), and relational operators. The order of precedence ensures that the logical AND is evaluated before the logical OR.

The conditional operator (a > b) ? a : b is used to determine the maximum of a and b based on a condition. The order of precedence ensures that the conditional operator is evaluated after the relational operator a > b.

### Review Questions
1. Question: What does the order of precedence determine in C++?
2. True/False: Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before operators with lower precedence. It defines the grouping and hierarchy of operators within an expression.
3. True/False:  Parentheses can be used to explicitly specify the order of evaluation within an expression, altering the default precedence.

*Answers: 1. **The order of precedence determines the sequence in which operators are evaluated within an expression.** 2. **True** 3. **True***

## Relational Operators and the string Type
The relational operators can compare variables of type string by comparing them character by character, following the ASCII collating sequence. Comparison starts from the first character and proceeds until either a mismatch is found or all characters are compared and found equal. If two strings of different lengths are compared and the characters are equal up to the last character of the shorter string, the shorter string is considered less than the longer string. 

## Review Questions

True or False: Relational operators can compare variables of type string character by character, following the ASCII collating sequence.
True
True or False: If two strings of different lengths are compared and the characters are equal up to the last character of the shorter string, the shorter string is considered greater than the longer string.
False
True or False: Relational operators for strings always compare the entire strings regardless of their lengths.
False

## Compound (Block of) Statements
 In C++, the if and if...else structures are designed to control the execution of only one statement at a time. However, there may be situations where you want to execute more than one statement if the expression evaluates to true. To accommodate such scenarios, C++ offers a structure known as a compound statement or a block of statements. A compound statement consists of one or more statements enclosed within curly braces { and }. When used within an if or if...else structure, a compound statement behaves as if it were a single statement, allowing for the execution of multiple statements based on the condition. 

## Review Questions

True or False: Compound statements in C++ consist of one or more statements enclosed within parentheses ().
False
True or False: Compound statements allow for the execution of multiple statements based on the condition in an if or if...else structure.
True
True or False: Compound statements are primarily used to control the execution of only one statement at a time.
False

 ## Multiple Selections: Nested if
 In programming, some situations require implementing more than two alternatives. For instance, consider a scenario where different interest rates are applied based on the checking account balance. This problem necessitates multiple selection paths, as there are four possible scenarios. To incorporate multiple selection paths in a program, nested if...else structures are used, especially when the action statement itself is an if or if...else statement. Nesting occurs when one control statement is placed within another. When dealing with nested if...else structures, it's crucial to pair each else with the appropriate if. In C++, there is no standalone else statement; every else must be associated with an if. The rule for pairing an else with an if is to associate the else with the most recent incomplete if, meaning the most recent if that hasn't been paired with an else. 

## Review Questions:

True or False: Nested if...else structures are used in programming to implement multiple selection paths.
True
True or False: Nesting occurs when one control statement is placed within another in a nested if...else structure.
True
True or False: Every else statement in C++ must be associated with an if.
True


 ## Short-Circuit Evaluation
Short-circuit evaluation is a mechanism used in programming languages, including C++, to optimize logical expressions by evaluating only the minimum number of operands necessary to determine the final result. This process avoids unnecessary evaluations, thereby improving performance and preventing potential errors. In short-circuit evaluation, logical operators such as && (logical AND) and || (logical OR) don't always evaluate both operands. Instead, they may stop evaluation as soon as the result can be determined based on the first operand encountered. For example, in a logical AND operation (&&), if the first operand evaluates to false, the overall result will be false regardless of the second operand's value. Similarly, in a logical OR operation (||), if the first operand evaluates to true, the overall result will be true without evaluating the second operand. This behavior allows programmers to write more concise and efficient code by taking advantage of logical shortcuts while ensuring correct behavior based on the defined conditions. 

## Review Questions

True or False: Short-circuit evaluation optimizes logical expressions by evaluating all operands regardless of the result.
False
True or False: In a logical AND operation (&&), if the first operand evaluates to false, the overall result will be false without evaluating the second operand.
True
True or False: Short-circuit evaluation is primarily used to introduce inefficiencies in logical expressions.
False

## Comparing Floating-Point Numbers for Equality: A Precaution
When comparing floating-point numbers for equality in programming, it's essential to exercise caution due to the inherent imprecision of floating-point arithmetic. This imprecision arises from the way floating-point numbers are represented in binary, leading to rounding errors and tiny discrepancies in calculations. Consequently, directly comparing two floating-point numbers for equality using the == operator may yield unexpected results due to these minute differences. Instead, it's generally recommended to compare floating-point numbers within a small tolerance range or epsilon value to accommodate for such discrepancies. This tolerance range allows for a more lenient comparison, acknowledging that two floating-point numbers may be considered "equal" if their difference falls within this range. By employing this precaution, programmers can ensure more robust and reliable comparisons when working with floating-point numbers, mitigating the effects of floating-point imprecision and avoiding potential pitfalls in their code. 

## Review Questions:

True or False: Directly comparing floating-point numbers for equality using the == operator may yield unexpected results due to rounding errors and imprecision.
True
True or False: It's generally recommended to compare floating-point numbers within a small tolerance range or epsilon value to accommodate for discrepancies.
True
True or False: Comparing floating-point numbers for exact equality is safe and reliable in programming.
False

## Associativity of Relational Operators: A Precaution
The associativity of relational operators is an important consideration in programming, especially when chaining multiple relational operators together in an expression. Relational operators like <, <=, >, and >= typically associate from left to right, meaning they are evaluated in the order they appear from left to right in an expression. However, it's crucial to note that associativity doesn't affect the outcome of individual comparisons but rather influences the grouping of operations when multiple operators of the same precedence level are present. To ensure clarity and avoid unintended behavior, programmers should use parentheses to explicitly specify the order of evaluation when mixing different relational operators in a single expression. This precaution helps to maintain code readability and prevents ambiguity, ensuring that the intended logic of the comparison is accurately conveyed and executed. By being mindful of the associativity of relational operators and using parentheses when necessary, programmers can write more understandable and predictable code, reducing the likelihood of errors and improving the overall quality of their programs. 

## Review Questions

True or False: Relational operators like <, <=, >, and >= associate from right to left in C++.
False
True or False: The associativity of relational operators affects the outcome of individual comparisons.
False
True or False: Using parentheses can help clarify the order of evaluation when mixing different relational operators in a single expression.
True
 
## Avoiding Bugs by Avoiding Partially Understood Concepts and Techniques
Avoiding bugs in software development entails a rigorous approach to understanding and implementing concepts and techniques comprehensively. Partially understood concepts or techniques can lead to subtle errors that may remain undetected until later stages of development or even after deployment. To mitigate this risk, developers should strive for a deep understanding of the tools, languages, libraries, and frameworks they use, rather than relying on superficial knowledge or assumptions. It's crucial to invest time in learning and practicing the fundamentals thoroughly, as well as staying updated with best practices and emerging trends in the field. Additionally, developers should prioritize clarity and readability in their code, favoring simplicity over complexity and avoiding overly clever or obscure solutions that may be difficult to maintain or debug. By approaching software development with a mindset of continuous learning, thorough understanding, and pragmatic implementation, developers can minimize the likelihood of introducing bugs stemming from partially understood concepts or techniques, thereby enhancing the reliability and quality of their software products.

## Input Failure and the if Statement
Input failure is a common issue encountered in programming when handling user input, particularly when using the cin statement in C++. When reading input from the user, unexpected data or invalid input formats can lead to input failure, causing the program to behave unpredictably or crash. To handle such situations gracefully, programmers often use conditional statements, particularly the if statement, to check for input failure before proceeding with further execution. By incorporating if statements to validate input, developers can detect and respond to input failure conditions, such as reaching the end of file or encountering incompatible data types, in a controlled manner. This allows the program to provide feedback to the user, prompt for corrected input, or handle the failure gracefully without crashing. Additionally, if statements can be combined with loop constructs to repeatedly prompt for valid input until successful, enhancing the robustness and usability of the program. Overall, leveraging the if statement to handle input failure is a fundamental practice in programming, enabling developers to create more resilient and user-friendly software applications. 

## Review Questions:

True or False: Input failure can occur when handling user input, particularly when using the cout statement in C++.
False
True or False: Incorporating if statements to validate input can help detect and respond to input failure conditions in a controlled manner.
True
True or False: Combining if statements with loop constructs can enhance the robustness and usability of a program when handling input failure.
True
 
## Confusion between the Equality Operator (==) and the Assignment Operator (=)
Confusion between the equality operator (==) and the assignment operator (=) is a common issue in programming, especially among beginners. The equality operator (==) is used to compare two values to determine if they are equal, while the assignment operator (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. The problem arises when a programmer mistakenly uses the assignment operator instead of the equality operator, or vice versa. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the program, as assignment changes the value of a variable, while comparison checks for equality without altering any values. To avoid this confusion, programmers should be diligent in using the correct operator in each context, double-checking their code for any instances where the wrong operator might have been employed. Additionally, some programming languages offer features or warnings to help mitigate this issue, such as compiler warnings or using different symbols for the two operators. Overall, understanding the distinction between the equality and assignment operators is fundamental in programming and can help prevent errors and bugs in code. 

## Review Questions:

True or False: The equality operator (==) is used to assign a value to a variable.
False
True or False: Confusion between the equality operator (==) and the assignment operator (=) can lead to unexpected behavior in a program.
True
True or False: Understanding the distinction between the equality and assignment operators is fundamental in programming to prevent errors and bugs in code.
True

## Conditional Operator (?:)
The conditional operator, often referred to as the ternary operator due to its three operands, is a compact and versatile tool in programming languages like C++ and Java. Its syntax consists of a conditional expression followed by a question mark (?), a value or expression to evaluate if the condition is true, a colon (:), and another value or expression to evaluate if the condition is false. The conditional operator serves as a shorthand for simple conditional statements, allowing for more concise code. It is particularly useful in situations where a simple decision needs to be made based on a condition, such as assigning a value to a variable or returning a value from a function. Despite its brevity, the conditional operator should be used judiciously to maintain code readability. Overuse or complex nesting of conditional operators can make code difficult to understand and maintain. Nonetheless, when employed appropriately, the conditional operator can enhance code clarity and efficiency by succinctly expressing conditional logic in a single line. 

## Review Questions:

True or False: The conditional operator is also known as the ternary operator because it has two operands.
False
True or False: The conditional operator is particularly useful for situations where a complex decision needs to be made based on multiple conditions.
False
True or False: Overuse of the conditional operator can improve code readability and maintainability.
False

## Program Style and Form (Revisited): Indentation
Indentation is a fundamental aspect of programming style and form that contributes significantly to code readability and maintainability. Proper indentation involves consistently indenting code blocks to visually represent their hierarchical structure, such as loops, conditionals, and function definitions. By aligning related statements and blocks of code, indentation enhances comprehension by making the program's structure more evident to developers. It also helps distinguish different levels of nesting, aiding in the identification of logical blocks and facilitating debugging and code review processes. Consistent indentation practices are essential for collaborative development environments, as they promote uniformity across the codebase and enable team members to understand and modify each other's code more efficiently. Furthermore, adherence to indentation conventions, whether using spaces or tabs, enhances code portability and compatibility across different programming environments and editors. Overall, prioritizing indentation as part of program style and form fosters cleaner, more readable codebases, contributing to improved code quality and developer productivity. 

## Review Questions:

True or False: Proper indentation enhances comprehension by making the program's structure less evident to developers.
False
True or False: Consistent indentation practices are essential for collaborative development environments to promote uniformity across the codebase.
True
True or False: Adherence to indentation conventions can enhance code portability and compatibility across different programming environments and editors.
True

## Chapter Summary 
* Control structures alter the normal flow of execution.

* The two most common control structures are selection and repetition.

* Selection structures incorporate decisions in a program.

* The relational operators are == (equality), < (less than), <= (less than or equal to), > (greater than), >= (greater than or equal to), and != (not equal to).

* Including a space within the relational operators ==, <=, >=, and != creates a syntax error.

* Characters are compared using a machineâ€™s collating sequence.

* Logical expressions evaluate to 1 (or a nonzero value) or 0. The logical value 1 (or any nonzero value) is treated as true; the logical value 0 is treated as false.

* There are two selection structures in C++.

* The expression in an if or if. . .else structure is usually a logical expression.

* Including a semicolon before the statement in a one-way selection creates a semantic error. In this case, the action of the if statement is empty.

* Including a semicolon before statement1 in a two-way selection creates a syntax error.

* There is no stand-alone else statement in C++. Every else has a related if.

* An else is paired with the most recent if that has not been paired with any other else.

* In C++, int variables can be used to store the value of a logical expression.

* In C++, bool variables can be used to store the value of a logical expression.

* In C++, the logical operators are ! (not), && (and), and || (or).

* A sequence of statements enclosed between curly braces, { and }, is called a compound statement or block of statements. A compound statement is treated as a single statement.

* You can use the input stream variable in an if statement to determine the state of the input stream.

* Using the assignment operator in place of the equality operator creates a semantic error. This can cause serious errors in the program.

* The switch structure is used to handle multiway selection.

* The execution of a break statement in a switch statement immediately exits the switch structure.

* If certain conditions are not met in a program, the program can be terminated using the assert function.

## Key Terms
1. **if Statement:**
   * Definition: A selection control structure that executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
2. **else Statement:**
   * Definition: Part of the selection control structure that provides an alternative block of code to execute when the condition in the corresponding if statement is false.
3. **Condition**:
   * Definition: An expression that evaluates to either true or false, influencing the execution path in a program.
4. **int**:
   * Definition: A fundamental data type in C++ representing integer values (whole numbers without a fractional part).
5. **bool**:
   * Definition: A fundamental data type in C++ representing Boolean values, i.e., either true or false.
