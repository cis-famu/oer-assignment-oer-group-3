tasked with designing a simple car inventory system. Each car has the following attributes:

Make (e.g., Toyota, Ford, Honda)
Model (e.g., Camry, Mustang, Civic)
Year of Manufacture
Color
Mileage

goal is to implement a class or data structure to represent a car and create a simple program that demonstrates the functionality of the car inventory system. The program should be able to:

Add a new car to the inventory.
Display the details of a specific car (given its make and model).
Display the total number of cars in the inventory.
Update the mileage of a specific car.
Remove a car from the inventory.

Consider how you can structure your code to efficiently manage the car inventory.
