# Basic Elements of C++

## Objectives
After completing this chapter students will be able to:
1. Identify basic components of a C++ program, including functions, special symbols, and identifiers
2. Classify simple data types and use them in assignment statements
3. Use arithmetic operators, precedence, and expressions
4. Create assignment and input statements and the use of variables within statements.
5. Differentiate between type conversion and type casting
6. Develop output results using output statements
7. Identify syntax errors and debugging techniques
8. Write a basic C++ program

## Introduction 
In this chapter, you will learn the basic elements and concepts of the C++ programming language to create C++ programs. In addition to giving examples to illustrate various concepts, we will also show C++ programs to clarify these concepts. 

## Basics of C++
As individuals begin their quest to master C++, they come across essential elements that lay the groundwork for this robust and flexible programming language. In this segment, we delve into four primary aspects of C++: comments, reserved words, identifiers, and functions.

### Comments 
In programming languages, comments hold significant importance as they offer a way for developers to add annotations to their code. These lines of text, not executed by the compiler during code compilation, are designed for human readers. Comments function as documentation, clarifications, or prompts for understanding the code's logic, facilitating better project comprehension, maintenance, and collaboration among developers.

C++ allows for two styles of comments. The first is the in-line comment. This is done by using // (two forward slashes). All text following this symbol is part of the comment.

For example:

```cpp
cout << "7 + 8 = " << endl; //prints: 7 + 8 = 15
```
